    "section": "",
    "text": "How do personality types compare across different, but culturally similar, countries?\nThe Big Five personality quiz is a significant and scientifically accepted test that assesses personality traits on five main scales: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The scales are shortened to the acronym OCEAN. Since the personality test is widely used, I was curious to see how different personality types would compare across different countries. Specifically, I was interested in seeing if ethnicity or culture is related to personality type.\nTo create an interesting analysis, I decided to look at two different regions, the Caribbean and South Asia. Specifically, the countries of Guyana, Trinidad, Jamaica, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. These regions are interesting because the Caribbean countries have a significant South Asian diaspora population.\nTo conduct this analysis, I looked at historical data of Big Five personality scores.\n\nHow do personality types compare across the Caribbean?\nI first looked at how the data compared across Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad, by importing the data and coding the following graph.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom IPython.display import display\n\n\nbig5_df = pd.read_csv('data/openpsych_data.csv', sep='\\t')\n\n\nfactor_map = { 1: 'E', \n               2: 'A',\n               3: 'C',\n               4: 'N',\n               5: 'O' }\n\n\nipip_df = pd.read_html('big5_questions.html', header=0)[0]\nipip_df = ipip_df.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 1': 'text', 'Unnamed: 7': 'factor_and_direction'})[['text','factor_and_direction']]\nipip_df[['factor','direction']]=ipip_df['factor_and_direction'].str.extract(r'([1-5])(.)')\nipip_df['category']=ipip_df['factor'].astype(int).map(factor_map)\n\n\nipip_df = ipip_df.assign(number=np.repeat(np.arange(1,11),5))\nipip_df = ipip_df.assign(qcode=ipip_df['category'].str.cat(ipip_df['number'].astype(str)))   \n\n\nneg_items = ipip_df.query('direction==\"-\"')['qcode']\n\n\nbig5_scored_df = big5_df.copy()\n\n\nbig5_scored_df[neg_items] = 6-big5_df[neg_items]\n\n\ncat_cols = {\n    cat : [f'{cat}{n+1}' for n in range(10)] \n    for cat in ('O','C','E','A','N') \n}\n\n\nfor cat, cols in cat_cols.items():\n    big5_scored_df[cat]=big5_scored_df[cols].sum(axis=1)\n\n\n(\n    big5_scored_df.query('country in [\"TT\",\"GY\",\"JM\"]').\n        groupby('country')[['O','C','E','A','N']].\n        agg('mean').\n        round(1).\n        transpose().\n        plot(kind='barh')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows that the Caribbean countries have a diverse set of scores on the Big 5 personality test. The countries score similarly for neuroticism, with Guyana and Trinidad almost scoring identically. Jamaica and Trinidad tend to have similar scores across all 5 factors, with Guyana as an outlier. The diverse personality types of this region can be explained by the region’s very diverse cultures and ethnicities. For example, the history and culture of Afro-, Indo-, and Indigenous Caribbeans can explain the varied personality scores. However, it is interesting to note the similarities between Jamaica and Trinidad.\n\n\nHow do personality types compare across the South Asian?\nI then created an identical graph, comparing the personality scores of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan.\n\n(\n    big5_scored_df.query('country in [\"IN\",\"PK\",\"BD\"]').\n        groupby('country')[['O','C','E','A','N']].\n        agg('mean').\n        round(1).\n        transpose().\n        plot(kind='barh')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows that the South Asian subcontinent scored almost identically on all five aspects of the Big 5 personality score. This comparison is very interesting and can also be explained by the history and cultures of these three countries. Especially since the countries are close in proximity and were all once part of the greater Indian colony of Great Britain.\n\n\nComparison of Both Regions\n\n(\n    big5_scored_df.query('country in [\"TT\",\"GY\",\"JM\",\"IN\",\"PK\",\"BD\"]').\n        groupby('country')[['O','C','E','A','N']].\n        agg('mean').\n        round(1).\n        transpose().\n        plot(kind='barh')\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this merge graph, further comparisons can be drawn. Again, the six countries have diverse scores for the different factors. Guyana is again an outlier since it has the most differing score compared to the other 5 countries, specifically extraversion and conscientiousness.\nThe comparison of these two regions does not necessarily prove that the country has a direct relationship with personality type. However, in the case of South Asia, the strong similarities between the three countries can imply a relationship, perhaps rooted in the shared history of the region. While the difference in the Caribbean countries can be a result of the racial and historical diversity of the region.\nOverall, these graphs provide an interesting analysis on the role of cultural simialrities in the personality type of populations!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "What time of the year, on average, is the best time to host summer parties in Philadelphia?\nFor the best summer parties, whether it’s a pool party or an outdoor barbecue, two important factors are necessary: it’s warm outside, and there is no rain. Sometimes, people need to plan their summer parties in advance to accommodate any travel plans. l\nTo give Philadelphia’s residents a better idea of when to host these summer parties, I analyzed weather data from 2010 to 2025 to determine what days tend to have the warmest temperatures or the most rainfall.\n\nWhat tends to be the warmest time of the year in Philadelphia?\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nweather_df = pd.read_csv('philadelphia_weather_2005_to_2025.csv')\nweather_df = weather_df.assign(date=pd.to_datetime(weather_df['date']))\n\n\nweather_df = weather_df[weather_df[\"date\"].dt.year &gt;= 2010]\n\n\nwarmest_days = weather_df.loc[\n    weather_df.groupby(weather_df[\"date\"].dt.year)[\"high\"].idxmax()\n]\n\nwarmest_days[[\"date\", \"high\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nhigh\n\n\n\n\n2013\n2010-07-07\n103\n\n\n2393\n2011-07-22\n103\n\n\n2744\n2012-07-07\n101\n\n\n3120\n2013-07-18\n98\n\n\n3469\n2014-07-02\n96\n\n\n3897\n2015-09-03\n96\n\n\n4242\n2016-08-13\n98\n\n\n4546\n2017-06-13\n96\n\n\n4931\n2018-07-03\n98\n\n\n5314\n2019-07-21\n98\n\n\n5662\n2020-07-03\n97\n\n\n6024\n2021-06-30\n97\n\n\n6413\n2022-07-24\n99\n\n\n6823\n2023-09-07\n97\n\n\n7112\n2024-06-22\n98\n\n\n7479\n2025-06-24\n101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table, you can see that Philadelphia mostly sees high temperatures between 96 and 103. Most of these dates occur in July and August. When you take the average of these days, you get July 16.\nThis data shows that Philadelphia residents can trust July and August for hosting their summer parties and can expect high and warm temperatures. Specifically, July 16 seems like the safest bet for a pool party, since history shows that the warmest temperatures occur around this date every year.\n\n\nWhat tends to be the rainiest time of the year in Philadelphia?\n\n\nrainiest_days = weather_df.loc[\n    weather_df.groupby(weather_df[\"date\"].dt.year)[\"rain\"].idxmax()\n]\n\nrainiest_days[[\"date\", \"rain\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nrain\n\n\n\n\n2099\n2010-10-01\n3.00\n\n\n2416\n2011-08-14\n4.84\n\n\n2803\n2012-09-04\n3.12\n\n\n3130\n2013-07-28\n8.02\n\n\n3406\n2014-04-30\n4.42\n\n\n3904\n2015-09-10\n4.76\n\n\n4158\n2016-05-21\n1.96\n\n\n4641\n2017-09-16\n2.58\n\n\n4997\n2018-09-07\n4.54\n\n\n5283\n2019-06-20\n2.87\n\n\n5694\n2020-08-04\n4.16\n\n\n6083\n2021-08-28\n3.17\n\n\n6483\n2022-10-02\n1.99\n\n\n6925\n2023-12-18\n2.19\n\n\n7021\n2024-03-23\n3.09\n\n\n7368\n2025-03-05\n1.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table, we can see that September and the fall months tend to have the most rainfall, with up to 8 inches of rain in August. The rainfall data is more scattered, though, and is not concentrated to one specific month.\nHowever, when we take the average of these dates, we get July 30.\nFrom this, we can determine that hosting summer parties is not a good idea toward the end of July. Additionally, hosting outdoor parties is also not a good idea at the beginning of fall. Not just because of the weather, but also because it could rain.\n\n\nConclusion\nAfter reviewing this data, we can determine that the best time of year to host a summer party is mid-July. This time of year has the warmest weather, according to the average data. Mid-July also swiftly avoids any rainfall. This is perfect for any Fourth of July barbecue!"
